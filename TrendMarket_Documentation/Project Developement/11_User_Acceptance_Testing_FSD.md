## 5. Bug Tracking Log

| Bug ID | Bug Description | Steps to Reproduce | Severity | Status | Additional Feedback |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **BG-001** | Cart is cleared when shopper logs out and logs in as a different user. | 1. Add items to cart as User A. <br>2. Log out. <br>3. Log in as User B. | Low | **Closed** | This is the expected security behavior; cart context state resets on auth token deletion. |
| **BG-002** | Product details page throws an undefined error if the product ID in URL does not exist in MongoDB. | 1. Manually enter `/product/999999` in browser address bar. | Medium | **Closed** | Fixed by adding error boundary middleware and redirecting invalid IDs to a 404 page. |
